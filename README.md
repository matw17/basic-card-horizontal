## Documentation for Business Card

This was my first ever web page, my first real encounter with coding, html, and css. The purpose of this site is to display my name, what I do, and where people can reach me. I learned a lot about the process of creating and editing code as well as some lessons about just how precise and thoughtful you have to be when creating something that is publicly accessible. My project consists of (in order) my name at the top of the page, a logo I created from my initials for this project, the words graphic design, and links to my linkedin, instagram, and email with a symbol next to each. The background is a black and white photograph I took in downtown New Bedford.
